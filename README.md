## Developing the site

### Prerequisites

The site is developed in react, for a quick start guide to react see [their website](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

You will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) in order to use npm (node package manager).

Clone the repo and navigate to the root directory "agjail.github.io" and run the following command to install pre-requisite modules.

```bash
npm install
```

### Launching the dev server

Launch the development server on your computer with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch a local server and that automatically reloads when code is edited.


## Deploying the Site

To build and deploy to github pages, use the command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will create a production build of the app and deploy it to the gh-pages branch, you should see updates on the site a few minutes after.
